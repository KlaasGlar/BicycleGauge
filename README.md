# BicycleGauge

## Introduction

This project features an advanced computer for use on bicycles.
A microcontroller reads sensor data and sends it to a smartphone via bluetooth.

## Feature list

The following features are going to be integrated in the prototype:
- Magnetic switch for reading the revolution speed of the pedals
- Magnetic switch at the back wheel for reading the absolute speed
- Solar cell for recharging the computer's battery (Li-Ion AAA battery)
- Bluetooth module for communication with the smartphone
- Magnetic sensor for the reading the earth's magnetic field to calculate the slope when going up/downhill
- Analog sensor to read the battery charge status
- All parts are going to be waterproofed for outdoor use

## Content of this repository

The repository contains the following things:
- Schematic ~~and PCB data~~ for the main PCB
- Schematic ~~and PCB data~~ for the magnetic switches
- ~~CAD data for the housing of the main PCB~~
- ~~Code for programming the microcontroller~~
- ~~Code for the Android App to connect to the computer~~

**_The project is currently in development. New things are added little by little.
My plan is to have the prototype running by end of July 2019.
See the roadmap below for the current status._**

## Future ideas

- Voltage / current sensor to measure the power generated by the solar cell
- Smaller Battery if overall power consumption is measured to be sufficiently low
